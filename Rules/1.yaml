ir:
  scope:
    - contractDefinition: The specification applies to smart contracts implementing token standards.
    - functionDefinition: The `symbol` function is defined within the contract.
  normativity:
    - OPTIONAL: The `symbol` function is optional, as stated explicitly in the specification.
    - MUST: Interfaces and contracts MUST NOT expect the `symbol` function to be present, per the specification.
  signature:
    - functionDefinition: The `symbol` function is defined as `function symbol() public view returns (string)`.
    - visibility: The function has `public` visibility.
    - stateMutability: The function is `view`, indicating it does not modify state.
    - returnParameters: The function returns a `string` typeName.
  required_behavior:
    - block: The function must return the token's symbol, e.g., "HIX".
    - returnStatement: The function must include a return statement providing the token symbol.
  guards_and_failures:
    - revertStatement: Callers MUST handle cases where the function fails or returns `false`.
  state_effects:
    - stateVariableDeclaration: The function does not modify any state variables due to its `view` stateMutability.
  observables:
    - eventDefinition: No events are emitted by this function.
    - callArgument: The returned `string` value is observable to the caller.
  gaps:
    - The specification implies handling `false` return values, but the GrammarGraphJSON lacks explicit concepts for boolean expressions or error handling in this context. Approximated using revertStatement.
    - The specification does not detail how the symbol is stored or retrieved, which could involve stateVariableDeclaration or mappingType concepts not explicitly mentioned.
