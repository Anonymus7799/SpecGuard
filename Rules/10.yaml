  scope:
    - The `Approval` event is defined within a contractDefinition as part of the contractBodyElement.
  normativity:
    - MUST: The `Approval` event MUST be emitted on any successful call to the functionDefinition `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)` as specified in the standard.
  signature:
    - The `Approval` event is an eventDefinition with eventParameter elements: `address indexed _owner`, `address indexed _spender`, and `uint256 _value`.
  required_behavior:
    - The functionDefinition `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)` MUST include an emitStatement to trigger the `Approval` event.
  guards_and_failures:
    - If the `approve` function fails due to invalid input or insufficient permissions, a revertStatement SHOULD be used to prevent state changes.
  state_effects:
    - The `approve` function MAY update a stateVariableDeclaration or mappingType to record the approved allowance for `_spender`.
  observables:
    - The `Approval` eventDefinition is observable via an emitStatement, with eventParameter values `_owner`, `_spender`, and `_value` passed as callArgument elements.
  gaps:
    - The specification does not explicitly define the internal logic of the `approve` function, such as how allowances are stored or validated. This was approximated using stateVariableDeclaration and mappingType concepts.
