  scope:
    - This specification applies to a functionDefinition within a contractDefinition implementing the ERC-20 standard.
  normativity:
    - MUST: The functionDefinition for `balanceOf` must adhere to the ERC-20 standard, as specified in the abstract and motivation sections.
  signature:
    - The functionDefinition has a parameterList containing one parameter of typeName `address` named `_owner`.
    - The functionDefinition has visibility set to `public`.
    - The functionDefinition has stateMutability set to `view`.
    - The functionDefinition has returnParameters specifying a typeName of `uint256` named `balance`.
  required_behavior:
    - The functionDefinition must include a block that retrieves the balance of the `_owner` account using a stateVariableDeclaration or mappingType.
    - The functionDefinition must include a returnStatement that outputs the retrieved balance as a uint256.
  guards_and_failures:
    - Callers MUST handle `false` from the returnStatement, as specified in the notes. This implies the need for an ifStatement or revertStatement to manage failure conditions.
  state_effects:
    - The functionDefinition must read from a stateVariableDeclaration or mappingType representing account balances.
  observables:
    - The functionDefinition does not emitStatement or eventDefinition, as it is purely a view function.
  gaps:
    - The specification implies the use of expressions to retrieve balances, but the GrammarGraphJSON lacks explicit expression rules. This was approximated using stateVariableDeclaration and mappingType.
    - The handling of `false` in the returnStatement is implied but lacks explicit representation in the GrammarGraphJSON. This was approximated using ifStatement and revertStatement.
